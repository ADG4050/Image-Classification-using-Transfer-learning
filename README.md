This code was developed for purely academic purposes by (ADG4050) as part of the module of Deep Learning and Applications (EE5C16) in Trinity College Dublin.

The code uses the model generated from https://github.com/ADG4050/Image-Classification-using-Neural-Network and it is trained and fine tuned with new features to test the data.
